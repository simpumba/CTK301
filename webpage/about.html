            <p>I’ve always had a deep connection with music, having even dabbled in piano for a brief time, but my true passion lies in sound design, especially in the world of video games. What fascinates me most is how sound can shape the entire gaming experience, from the emotional weight of a soundtrack to the impact of sound effects in combat, and even the subtle sounds that create a cozy atmosphere or ramp up the tension in a horror game.

            While I’ve only been honing my sound design skills for a few months, my fascination with its role in games has been growing for over a year. Watching video essays and learning how sound enhances the gaming experience led me to pursue sound design further and even start college for it. My work so far has focused on sound for animation, as it allows me to refine my skills and develop a solid foundation in sound fundamentals. I’ve also been experimenting with Unity projects to implement sound and gain hands-on experience.
                
            My approach to sound design is all about complementing the story and environment. Whether it’s creating an unsettling atmosphere for a tense moment or crafting sound effects that enhance combat, I aim to use sound to amplify the emotional depth of the narrative. Every element—from the background ambiance to the UI sounds—should help immerse the player in a believable, dynamic world.
                
            I am passionate about the potential of sound to transform a game into a fully realized experience. My goal is to focus on sound design for video games full-time, ultimately working with a team that shares my vision. One of my ultimate dreams is to contribute to the incredible work being done at Larian Studios.</p>

            <p>Since I was a kid, I've played videogames on the Nintendo Cube, playing things like Super Smash Bros with my brother and sisters, and Mario Party. However growing up I mainly played on the Xbox growing up until around high school where I bought a computer for myself, and thats where I started to play more RPG and single player focused videogames. The first game I ever played on PC was Mass Effect 1 because of my brothers suggestions, which really built me into a RPG kind of gamer. 

            I grew up near Chicago as a kid and would always play outside with childhood friends, and one of my favorite things to do as a kid was play Halo with my friends at their house, and dig small rivers far in their back yards in the mud during the summer. One of my favorite childhood games is a old, old game called Wizard101 which is how I met my childhood friends as a kid, but also ironically how I met most of my closest friends today.
